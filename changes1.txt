Implemented Observer design pattern: TraderObserver.java, StockExchangeObservable.java are the added changes to the api and DefaultTraderObserver.java is the implementation. I created a new stub class StubTraderObserver to help me with the test cases. I altered the stockExchangeAndTraderTest to test if a Trader Observer gets updated when a trade happens.

Reason: Because ohterwise the system does not allow traders to receive information about trades.


Trade-offs:

Did not notice any.
